# learning-github
First repository, created to learning purposes, for beginners, by a beginner.
I am a 30 year old guy, who is looking to learn python from zero to hero.
I live in Pennsylvania, with my family and a bunch of pets.
I like to read, learn about new technologies, and help others.
I hope to get better about talking about myself, my strengths and my weaknesses, through writing.
