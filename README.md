# learning-github
First repository, created to learning purposes, for beginners, by a beginner.
I am a 30 year old guy, who is looking to learn python from zero to hero.
I live in Pennsylvania, with my family and a bunch of pets.
I like to read, learn about new technologies, and help others.
I hope to get better about talking about myself, my strengths and my weaknesses, through writing.
I will add some more information here, about myself, at a future date.

# accomplishments reference: https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/

    Started and managed a new branch
    Changed a file and committed those changes to GitHub
    Opened and merged a Pull Request
    
# python code
There will be some python code here at some point.
It will be very basic python code, but everyone needs to start at the beginning.
